<h1 align="center">HN Tech News - a yamanlabs project</h1>

This project is a tech news aggregator for posts on Hacker News. It fetches top stories from the Hacker News API, enriches them with Open Graph metadata, and displays them in a clean, responsive interface with AI-powered features.

The motivation behind this project was to fully utilize vibe-code tools and experiment with them. Also, I wanted to use Gemini for a practical application that I would use daily and might be useful for others as well. Don't expect to see any clean code or best practices here - this was a fun experiment and a learning experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Summaries:** On-demand summaries of articles generated by `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`.
- **Dynamic Story Data:** Story scores and comment counts are updated in the background.
- **Top 30 Stories:** Displays the current top 30 articles from Hacker News.
- **Metadata Enrichment:** Scrapes `og:image` and `og:description` from each article for a richer preview.

- **Background Refresh:** The cache is automatically updated every 15 minutes.
- **Bookmarks with Notifications:** Save your favorite stories locally in your browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üöÄ Running the Project

### Running Locally for Development

This method is best for active development, as it provides hot-reloading for the frontend.
A script is provided to run both the backend and frontend concurrently.

**Prerequisites:**
- Go (1.23+)
- Node.js (18+)

**Setup:**

1.  **Environment:**
    The backend requires a Gemini API key  to generate summaries and the frontend requires the base API url. Create a file named `.env.development` in the `/` directory:
    ```env
    # /.env.development
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    PRIVATE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    Just run the following command in the root directory:
    ```bash
    ./dev.sh
    ```
